67272 Creamery Project: Phase 5 
---
This is a project that I developed for my Application Design and Development my Sophomore year. It is a Ruby on Rails application for a fictional Creamery, used to display information to customers as well as for the administrators, managers, and employees to keep track of hours and a variety of other data. I wrote all the models, controllers, and views in the project, and created all of the design.
